The standalone build should not be used alongside a pre-bundled build of a user-facing renderer, as they will have different internal storage for reactivity connections. A user-facing renderer should re-export all APIs from this package.\n\nFor full exposed APIs, see `src/index.ts`.\n\n## Credits\n\nThe implementation of this module is inspired by the following prior art in the JavaScript ecosystem:\n\n- [Meteor Tracker](https://docs.meteor.com/api/tracker.html)\n- [nx-js/observer-util](https://github.com/nx-js/observer-util)\n- [salesforce/observable-membrane](https://github.com/salesforce/observable-membrane)\n\n## Caveats\n\n- Built-in objects are not observed except for `Array`, `Map`, `WeakMap`, `Set` and
